# web-server-using-TCP-UDP-protocols

We have implemented a web server using TCP & UDP protocols which will help us to serve small-sized images. This server produces client-specific picture names by attaching the file descriptor value as a suffix. This is a simple example of a web server, but it teaches the essentials of network communication.
We are saving the image name as image_ (server address).jpg


Steps to execute the Assignment1 UDP
1. Run thhe UDP server file it runs on the localhost with port 8080 make sure these are not in use or can change them to the host and port which are available
2. Run the UDPclient file it automatically requests the image from S_files folder as server files and get the requested image saves in the C_files folder as client files.
